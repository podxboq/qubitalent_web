Key Features That Set Us Apart
Explore the features that set us apart.
Quantum Error Correction
Quantum error correction is a set of techniques used to protect the information stored in qubits from errors and decoherence caused by noise.
We are focussed on breaking though this fundamental challenge, by building scalable control systems and fast decoders, and by understanding optimal quantum algorithms for error corrected quantum computers.
Quantum Computing
A new multidisciplinary field that includes aspects of computer science, physics and mathematics and that uses principles of fundamental physics, quantum mechanics.
The use of graphical language in quantum computing for the representation of algorithms, is not very useful for different tasks. We proposes a means to represent quantum circuits in a convenient and concise manner. The proposed notation allows the consistent and parameterized description of quantum algorithms.
Teaching
We know that the transfer of knowledge is necessary to train new generations, which is why we work with universities on training in this fascinating technological field.
Together with the International University of La Rioja (UNIR) we teach the subject quantum computing for the physics degree and direct several TFMs for the quantum computing master's degree.
